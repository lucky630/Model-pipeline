# Model-pipeline
machine learning pipeline for the different models

Config file is used to set the parameters.

These parameters are involved from setting the label and id columns as well as selecting which models want to use.

This Script will generate the Cross validation set and the test set which can be used in the next layer of stacking.

It will also create the Performance csv file which will be used to record all the progress and accuracy of different combinations of techniques.

it is the second layer of pipeline used after the first layer of preprocessing pipeline and before the stacking pipeline.other two pipelines will be shared soon.

only be used for the Structured Tabular form of data sets.
